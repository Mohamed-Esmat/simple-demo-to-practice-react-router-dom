## Introduction

>> This is a simple demo application showcasing the use of React Router and authentication with a dummy Node.js backend. It is designed to help you understand how to set up routing and implement user authentication in a React application.


## Features

- **Authentication:** User authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access.
- **Protected Routes:** Certain routes are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.
- **Routing:** Dynamic routing and navigation using React Router DOM.
- **Dummy Backend:** A mock Node.js backend for simulating API requests and user data storage.
- **User Registration:** Allows users to register and create an account.
- **Login and Logout:** Users can log in and log out of their accounts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your development machine.
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) for editing and running the code.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-router-auth-demo.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-router-auth-demo
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Configure the backend:

   - Open the `config.js` file in the `server` directory.
   - Adjust the configuration settings such as the port and database connection as needed.

2. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

3. Configure the frontend:

   - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Add the following environment variables:

     ```plaintext
     REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:YOUR_BACKEND_PORT
     ```

   Replace `YOUR_BACKEND_PORT` with the port number you configured for the backend.

## Usage

1. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your web browser and access the application at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by the React development server).

3. Explore the application, register a new user account, log in, and navigate through the protected routes to see authentication in action.

## Folder Structure
